It's an ordinary day though, I am getting to discover the beauty of my life.

It may be difficult sometimes, because of the pressure of earning a living, or the stress of peer pressure, or even because of the rainy weather. It's easy to become trapped, depressed. 

However, it's not a bad thing. You begin to notice the trivial of life. And it's just where the beauty resides. When I feel frustrated, an invisible strong force of life makes me even hard to breathe. But it's so vivid, so lively, I can even touch it. I know this is the real side of life. It tastes sweet, it tastes bitter. 

From a year ago, my journey of becoming an excellent entrepreneur has already begun. There is still a long long way for me to go, however, I have indeed felt the joyfulness of growing up. Everyday I think about the effort I've made for my goal, I feel so happy. 

Life is not always easy, it's the bitterness makes it so wonderful.
